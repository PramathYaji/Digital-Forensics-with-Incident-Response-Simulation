### Preface - Scenario Design
I started off with the idea of simulating a cyberattack and then performing forensic analysis to understand what kind of data might have been exfiltrated. The initial approach was purely technical, there was no storyline behind it. It was just about carrying out an attack and analyzing the system later. At first, I explored the idea of DNS tunneling, but that plan was dropped since it would have required a registered domain to make it work well. 

From there, the scenario began to evolve. I decided to bring in a social engineering angle - something like phishing - and that’s when the story started taking shape. Instead of treating the insider as simply malicious, I thought it would be more interesting to present the user as someone who had been manipulated or coerced. This added a more layered perspective to the situation. 

As the storyline developed, I added in technical elements like phishing emails, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and privilege escalation through sudoers misconfiguration. The final scenario blended both behavioral and technical aspects, giving a well-rounded case to investigate from a forensic standpoint.
